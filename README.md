# Summary

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using online materials.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and good habits to obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners. 
It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements.

## Final project

OSS University is project-focused.
The assignments and exams for each course are to prepare you to use your knowledge to solve real-world problems.

After you've gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
Not only does real project work look great on a resume, but the project will also validate and consolidate your knowledge.
You can create something entirely new, or you can find an existing project that needs help via websites like
[CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
or
[First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/).

Students who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses. Here is a sample of options (many more are available, at this point you should be capable of identifying a series that is interesting and relevant to you):
